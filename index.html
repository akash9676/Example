          "Sebastian is a guru at all things UX design, consistently producing intuitive, modern, and bold designs. He is a natural problem solver in the design 
          space so everyone went to him if they were stuck on a feature or flow. He has a arsenal of design skills including animation and graphic design. Not to mention,
          Seb was a design team lead, which means he managed a full team of both onshore and offshore designs reviewing and providing feedback on all of their designs... 
          Any business would be lucky to have him."
